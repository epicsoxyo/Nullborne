# Nullborne
Game a Week 5 || Theme: The Enchanted Instrument

**Description:**
Nullborne is a rich story game developed in one week for Manchester Metropolitan University's fortnightly game jam, Game a Week. In this game, you play as the last Nullborne on Earth after your kind was driven to extinction. You receive a mysterious note and a strange device from your mother after she apparently vanishes into thin air...

**Gameplay:**
Use the ManaTech Glyph Transmuter to overcome your lack of abilities as a Nullborne. Sneak past the Guardians and find your mother before it is too late...

**Main Mechanic:**
Nullborne uses its own basic bytecode VM and compiler as a game mechanic. While not hugely extensive, this has taught me some of the basics of how bytecode can work as part of a game.

**Controls:**
- **WASD:** Move
- **E:** Interact
- **TAB:** Switch UI screens
- **ESC:** Skip cutscene 

**Features:**
- Immersive story
- Unique bytecode mechanic
- Charming dialogue and characters
