  dialogue:
  - In a world where magic reigns supreme, where the very essence of power flows
    through the veins of its inhabitants, lies a city pulsating with life and energy.
  - A city built upon the death of all humans.
  - 'Long ago, a select few were born with the power to wield magic: the manabornes.'
  - The ManaTech corporation harnessed this mystical force through the harvesting
    of the manaborne, integrating it into their groundbreaking technology.
  - But with great power came great unrest.
  - The manabornes rose against their oppressors, unleashing their wrath upon those
    without the gift.
  - In the wake of the uprising, non-magic humans -- eventually dubbed the 'nullbornes'
    -- became extinct, and all the ManaTech devices were destroyed.
  - It was made universal law that all nullbornes be put to death, to further the
    evolution of humanity.
  - "Yet, thirteen years ago, a glimmer of hope emerged. Concealed from the eyes
    of society, a child\u2014the first nullborne in generations\u2014was born."
  - Raised in solitude by their loving mother, they spent their life sheltered from
    the prejudice of the world beyond.
  - But fate is a cruel mistress.
  - The child's mother one day disappeared without a trace, leaving nothing but a
    note and a strange device.
  - '"My dear child, if you are reading this note I am afraid you may never see me
    again.'
  - '"I must go to the capital, as there is something I have to accomplish.'
  - '"I have left you with a ManaTech Glyph Transmuter; it is the last of its kind,
    so you must keep it safe. If ever you are in trouble, it in turn will keep you
    safe.'
  - '"I know that you are much smarter than I was at your age. Please know that I
    love you dearly. Take care of yourself; perhaps I will see you again someday."'
  - Now, burdened with the grief and curiosity at the loss of their mother, the Nullborne
    embarks on a quest for answers.
  - Yet, perhaps this journey will result in more than they had bargained for...
